# 05 - Project Progress Log

This document tracks the major development milestones and decisions made during the project's lifecycle.

### **Phase 1: Initial Scaffolding & Proof of Concept**
- **Status:** Complete
- **Details:**
    - Set up the initial monorepo structure with `frontend` and `backend` directories.
    - Created a basic React application with Tailwind CSS.
    - Built a basic FastAPI backend with an OpenAI integration.
    - Established the initial connection between the frontend and backend.

### **Phase 2: Pivot to Provider-Facing Tool**
- **Status:** Complete
- **Details:**
    - Replaced the initial patient-facing form with a provider-focused `EncounterNotesForm`.
    - Updated the backend to accept unstructured notes and return a full SOAP analysis, including CDI codes and next steps.
    - Redesigned the UI to display the structured results clearly.

### **Phase 3: UI/UX Polishing & Refinement**
- **Status:** Complete
- **Details:**
    - Implemented a professional "Acorn" header and a two-screen (form/results) user flow.
    - Created a dedicated `AnalysisResults` component with a tabbed layout and copy-to-clipboard functionality.
    - Enhanced the input form with "Load Example" and "Clear" buttons, autofocus, and dynamic submit logic.
    - Improved form validation feedback with icons and subtle animations.

### **Phase 4: Deployment**
- **Status:** Complete
- **Details:**
    - Successfully deployed the FastAPI backend to **Render**.
    - Successfully deployed the React frontend to **Vercel** after a significant and educational debugging process.
    - The most critical issue was a line in the root `.gitignore` file (`public`) that was preventing the `frontend/public` directory from being committed to the repository. Resolving this was the key to a successful Vercel build.

### **Next Steps**
- Begin a new development phase focusing on Tier 3 enhancements (e.g., live character counts) or new major features (e.g., user accounts, note history).
