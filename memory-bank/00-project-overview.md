# 00 - Project Overview

## Project Name
**Acorn** - AI-Powered SOAP Note Assistant

## Core Goal
To provide healthcare professionals with a tool that can take unstructured, natural language encounter notes and instantly transform them into a structured, clinically useful format.

## Key Objectives
1.  **Reduce Documentation Time:** Eliminate the need for providers to manually structure their notes into Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) categories.
2.  **Enhance Clinical Insights:** Automatically identify key findings, critical points, and clinical impressions from the raw text.
3.  **Support Clinical Documentation Improvement (CDI):** Suggest relevant ICD-10 codes based on the conditions and symptoms mentioned in the notes.
4.  **Provide Actionable Guidance:** Offer a clear list of recommended next steps and follow-up priorities for the provider.

## Project Journey
This project began as a patient-facing symptom checker. Through development, it was pivoted into a more valuable provider-facing tool focused on clinical documentation and decision support. The primary user interface is a simple, single-textbox form, emphasizing ease of use and a fast, seamless workflow.
